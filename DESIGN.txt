There were several methods in the functions class which I did not feel were necessary to move elsewhere. 
For the method load() I did not feel it was needed for load() to belong to any one class.
For the method processline(), there were multiple methods for which the method could have belonged to. 
The method ParseMiner() could have been placed in multiple classes.
The method ParseOre() can be placed in multiple classes to be called on by the functions.
The method ParseSmith() can be placed in multiple classes and as such is better to be placed in functions.
The method ParseBackground(), could have been placed in multiple classes.
The method clamp() could be placed in multiple different classes.
By doing this project we understand the importance of methods belonging to specific classes.
