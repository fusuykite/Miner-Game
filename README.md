# Miner-Game
A java based user interactive game implementing both an A Star Pathing Algorithm and a Single Step Pathing Strategies. 

Using either A Star or Single Step Miners will locate the nearest Ore and return it to the Blacksmith. 
If an Ore is not collected in time, the Ore will be eaten by an Ore Blob (not a good thing). 


Christmas Edition Updates:
1) To trigger an event simply click anywhere within the game. 

2) The event chosen is a winter forest that spawns around the mouse click. 

3) Any miners within proximity of the forest will turn into super reindeer which are able 
to collect Ores far faster than the normal miner. (Super Reindeer are how Santa manages to 
fly around the world so fast!)

4) The new entity created from the forest event is a Santa entity. The Santa Entity works 
to find and destroy any ore blobs in sight.
